# code_runner.vim

A vim/neovim plugin to run selected chunks of code or whole files. Can run locally or within docker or k8s containers

Use cases:
- light weight database client by executing chunks of code and respecting db env vars
- light weight redis client by executing chunks of commands and respecting redis env vars
- execute tagged code blocks in markdown files
- execute chunks of code or whole files for script languages

## Motivation: <a id="motivation"></a>

Are you tired of having to switch sql/nosql clients and relearning how the tool works?

Would you rather just have a basic interface for running whatever code you need; in or out of a container?

Well this plugin has your covered.

This plugin believes in ui compatibility. Need to see what tables you have access to? You can create a bash script to cache db information. Then you fzf or telescope and rbql to find the db information you need in the db cache. This way, you are using tools that can be used for other purposes aswell and you are building your skill set to solve real problems that you have. Not to mention this way of finding information is stronger than the tools that clients give you.

## Supported editors: <a id="supported_editors"></a>
- vim
- neovim

## Supported Runners (in order of runner search): <a id="supported_runners"></a>

### Extra condition for .sh files that can redirect to other runners:

If your `.sh` file starts with a shebang to use a different command and you select that line (or run the whole shell file), then an attempt to use said program will occur instead of using `sh`.

### How a runner is selected:

`g:vim_code_runner_runner_configs` runner ordered list drives the runner selection

### Add a runner

You can add a new runner by prepending or appending a runner to `g:vim_code_runner_runner_configs`

NOTE: the order of `g:vim_code_runner_runner_configs` is important. The first runner that matches the conditions in the function `_VCR_IsRunner` will be choosen

NOTE: you can also reorder `g:vim_code_runner_runner_configs` all together

---

## Runner Options: <a id="runner_options"></a>

```vim
" will run in the container if this is set to non empty string (Default: unset)
let vim_code_runner_container_name="container_name" |
" specify what kind of container you want to run in. Valid choices: ["docker", "k8s"] (Default: docker)
let vim_code_runner_container_type="docker" |
" Recommend using 'mechatroner/rainbow_csv' for the 'rfc_csv' filetype  (Default: csv)
let vim_code_runner_csv_type="rfc_csv" |
" will decide if sql output will be in csv format or the default for the sql cli tool being used (Default: true)
let vim_code_runner_sql_as_csv="true" |
" the number of  commands and query results saved (Default: 10) for array size of vim_code_runner_last_n_query_results
let vim_code_runner_history_size="10" |
" A label that will be prepended to all debug logs (Default: "DEBUG-> ")
let vim_code_runner_debug_label="DEBUG-> " |
" fallback file_type used in all runners (Default: "log")
let vim_default_file_type="log" |
" override for the command used to write configs for some sql runners (Default: "echo" for mariadb, "echo -e" for mysql)
let vim_code_runner_config_writer="echo" |
" converts " to CHAR(34) -- NOTE: only mssql runner
let vim_code_runner_should_convert_double_quotes="true" |
```

NOTE: changing values of any of the `_vcr*` variables may lead to problems!

### Specific Runner Options: <a id="specific_runner_options"></a>

#### psql:

```vim
let $PGHOST="127.0.0.1" |
let $PGPORT="5432" |
let $PGDATABASE="postgres" |
let $PGUSER="postgres" |
let $PGPASSWORD="password" |
```

#### sqlite:

```vim
" the following are used only when vim_code_runner_container_name is not set
let $SQLITEDBFILE="./main.sqlite" |
```

#### mssql:

```vim
let $SQLCMDSERVER="127.0.0.1" |
let $SQLCMDPORT="5432" |
let $SQLCMDDBNAME="mssql" |
let $SQLCMDUSER="mssql" |
let $SQLCMDPASSWORD="password" |
let $SQLCMDINTSEC="false" |
```

#### mysql/mariadb:

```vim
let $MYSQLHOST="127.0.0.1" |
let $MYSQLPORT="5432" |
let $MYSQLDATABASE="mysql" |
let $MYSQLUSER="mysql" |
let $MYSQLPASSWORD="password" |
```

NOTE: `let vim_code_runner_sql_as_csv='true' |` is supported through a hack.

Use `let vim_code_runner_sql_as_csv='false' |` if your query would have hard tab characters in the results.

Commas from the values will be represented by ';' instead

#### cassandra:

```vim
let $CASSANDRA_HOST="127.0.0.1" |
let $CASSANDRA_PORT=3306 |
let $CASSANDRA_DATABASE="cassandra" |
let $CASSANDRA_USER="cassandra" |
let $CASSANDRA_PASSWORD="password" |
```

NOTE: very basic runner

TODOS:
  improve creds process to get rid of warning
  add csv toggle

#### neo4j:

```vim
let $NEO4J_HOST="127.0.0.1" |
let $NEO4J_PORT=7474 |
let $NEO4J_DATABASE="neo4j" |
let $NEO4J_USER="neo4j" |
let $NEO4J_PASSWORD="password" |
```

NOTE: Only used in basic query situations. Needs more testing in complex situations

#### mongodb:

```vim
let $MONGODBHOST="127.0.0.1" |
let $MONGODBPORT="5432" |
let $MONGODBUSER="mongodb" |
let $MONGODBPASSWORD="password" |
```

#### redis:

```vim
let $REDISHOST="127.0.0.1" |
let $REDISPORT="6379" |
let $REDISUSER="username" |
let $REDISPASSWORD="password" |
let $REDISTLS="false" |
let $REDISCLI_AUTH="asdf1234" |
```

## Recommended Keybindings: <a id="recommended_keybindings"></a>

```vim
" runs the selected_text with the determined run_type
vmap <leader>5 "ty:call VimCodeRunnerRun(@t)<CR>
" dry run / debug what VimCodeRunnerRun() will do in a real run
vmap <leader>4 "ty:call VimCodeRunnerRun(@t, '', 'true')<CR>
" run whole file
nmap <leader>5 ggVG"ty<c-o>:call VimCodeRunnerRun(@t)<CR>
" dry run / debug whole file if run_type supports it
nmap <leader>4 ggVG"ty<c-o>:call VimCodeRunnerRun(@t, '', 'true')<CR>
```

## Pointers: <a id="pointers"></a>

### I closed the results of my last query and the query takes a large amount of time to run.

there is a global variable called vim_code_runner_last_query_result; it stores the results of your last query

use something like this command to get the content out of the variable
```vim
" in visual mode with a blank line selected
put =g:vim_code_runner_last_query_result
```

you can view even further back depending on your vim_code_runner_history_size setting with vim_code_runner_last_n_query_results list

## Contribution Requests: <a id="contribution_requests"></a>

requesting MRs for other code runners
if they have specific runner env vars, then also update VimCodeRunnerRunConfigs to include a case for it

- google firebase
- apache cassandra improvements
- elasticsearch
- neo4j improvements
- scylladb
- some other sql???
- some other nosql???
- mysql improve csv format by removing the HACK
- consider using shellescape instead of substitute(raw_text, "'", "'\"'\"'", "g")
- NOTE: may not work or may be complex due to container runs. consider moving config file or query file writing out of _command_prepend and just execute in place. would remove some string issues
- NOTE: may not work or may be complex due to container runs. switch to temp file based running instead of command string runs for runners that its possible for. will reduce number of issues overall

## Install: <a id="install"></a>

Use your plugin manager of choice such as vimplug or lazy as follows:

### VimPlug
```vim
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
" rest of your plugins ...
Plug 'MajorZiploc/code_runner.vim'
" rest of your plugins ...
call plug#end()
```

### Lazy (Example of Lazy being used inside of LunarVim)
```vim
lvim.plugins = {
  " rest of your plugins ...
  { "MajorZiploc/code_runner.vim" },
  " rest of your plugins ...
}
```
